To preview this documentation locally:

1. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) ( if you are running mac, you probably already have Ruby but don't use that because you need to elevate to root in order to install bundlers. Best to install a separate version that your userid has write access to)
2. Install Jekyll `gem install jekyll bundler`  (see [https://jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com) for more details)
3. Install Jekyll's dependencies `bundle install`
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Open browser [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)
